# Jarldom
Personal Game project being done currently as a group of friends. Jarldom is a roguelike deck builder where your goal is to collect resources from settlements and eliminate opposing Jarls of your land to expand your kingdom and bring wealth to your people.

You will be able to collect resources from foreign lands to upgrade your village and to spend for increasing your favor with your chosen gods. You will be able to build and upgrade buildings in your home village to give buff to your units, give more powerful effects to your lord, and increase the rewards of your adventures. You will also be able to upgrade your boat that you use to go raiding to increase the size of your deck of warriors and to reduce chances for potential bad events in your sailing.

Adventuring first starts with picking whether you will travel inland on your island to take over the villages of rival jarls where you will rally your warband and march on the opponent where you will encounter a boss fight. If you successfully defeat the jarl, you will gain new expansions to your village that you will be able to build and new warrior types that are special to the jarls. Your other choice will be to embark on raiding parties where you will go and raid the lands of those with more forgiving soil. Take food and materials from the inhabitants to bring on your boat back to your jarldom to help feed your people and build to survive the harsh climates of home. But what will you bring home as you can't carry the whole world back on your boat, and is it worth risking your soldiers for better loot?

Your units will have persist health through combats so you will have to be technical which who you use as you enter a battle as you might want to the save the better unit at low health for a tougher fight. You will as be able to play cards that invoke the gods to buff your warriors or to destroy your enemies, and the more you pray to those gods for their boons, the more watchful eye you will keep on their favorite disciple. You of course of also bought supplies to arm your warriors with or equipment for them to wear so that they may fight longer and bloodier and keep up with the advancements that other socities have obtained.
