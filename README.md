# Jarldom
Personal Game project being done currently as a group of friends. Jarldom is a roguelike deck builder where your goal is to collect resources from settlements and eliminate opposing Jarls of your land to expand your kingdom and bring wealth to your people.

You will be able to collect resources from foreign lands to upgrade your village and to spend for increasing your favor with your chosen gods. You will be able to build and upgrade buildings in your home village to give buff to your units, give more powerful effects to your lord, and increase the rewards of your adventures. You will also be able to upgrade your boat that you use to go raiding to increase the size of your deck of warriors and to reduce chances for potential bad events in your sailing.

Your units will have persist health through combats so you will have to be technical which who you use as you enter a battle as you might want to the save the better unit at low health for a tougher fight.
